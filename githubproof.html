<body>Attached below are images of my updated Github repository, where I consistently upload new versions of my code.
<p>In my first screenshot, you can see the basic workins of my code. This was when I first started on Github/my website so everything is in green, which signifies new additions.</p>

<p>In this screenshot, I omitted a few elements, which is therefore shown in red. Additionally, I added a lot of new features, such as a table containing all of my daily logs. To view that table in its entirety, click <a href="index.html">here!</a></p>

<p>The most notable change in my third screenshot is the addition of the lines containing "href=#weekx". If you look back at my landing page, there are four hyperlinks: week 1, week 2, and so on. The creation of this "href" allows you to click that text to be transported to the first daily log of that respective week!</p>

<p>In my last screenshot, I deviate a bit from the typical HTML – which is what I showed in the earlier pictures – and worked on my CSS, which stands for Custom Style Sheets. CSS is responsible for the aesthetic of the website - all the alignments, fonts, colors and the like. In this screenshot, specifically, I changed the colors of a few text elements within the various IDs on my page. IDs can be used as specific references to elements and/or parts on the page. Besides for the features edited in the picture, you can also see the attributes of "text-align", "font-family", and "padding" added in.</p>
