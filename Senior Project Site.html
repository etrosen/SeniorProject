<p>On my project, I will attempt to use Codecademy as a tool for learning the beginning of web development. I will work through their 14 course webdev and apply those new skills to building my own website through PyCharm CE, an application used for web development.<p>
<p>I chose to learn web development for my senior project because I had always had that idea that I wanted to start coding and building websites. I always had that intuition that it would be beneficial for college and for my career, though I never had a strong initiative to embark on learning it. Granted, I had no prior experience, so taking an app development class this year helped ease into the process a little more and will make starting web development a bit easier. I want to be able to use these skills in college and take computer science classes or help my peers learn these skills or with budding business ideas.</p>
<p>I hope to gain skills that I can apply in my college courses, in helping other teens build websites/learn comp sci., and to be a more attractive employment option when the time comes. Besides for those reasons, I was always fascinated by people discussing computer science and programming and I was never able to partake in that convo. I want to be able to learn skills to educate myself so that I can have those types of conversations. Additionally, I want to build websites and combine my business and programming affinities into a viable career or find jobs where I can combine the two.</p>
<p>I felt that, in order to best explain my progression through these past four weeks, I would add my Daily Logs and Weekly Reflections onto my site. <div id="pleaselook"><strong>Please look below for my journey through Senior Project!</strong></div></p>

    <td>On my first day of project, I began my 14-class web development course. I finished 100% of HTML, which creates the bare bones of the website, and am about to begin CSS, which is the aesthetic of the website. Being that I have only done HTML, if I were to create a website, it would be unorganized, unattractive, and dull. HTML and CSS will work together to create the appearance of the website. However, I will have to continue to learn more languages in order to create the back-end activity of the website.</td>

    <td>Today, I started the CSS class in Codecademy. In this lengthy class, I am learning about the aesthetic of the website and how to alert it. The various things we have control are the colors of both the text and background, their size, thickness, opacity, alignment, linking, location, and presentation. I am very interested in seeing how all of the pieces of the website creation are starting to be put together. Additionally, I had my first meeting with my sponsor, Ms. Simons. We checked in on my progress from yesterday and a bit of today and spoke briefly about my upcoming meeting with my out of school mentor, Mr. Chris Read, this Friday. We decided itâ€™d be beneficial to create a list of a few questions so I can get to know him better.
