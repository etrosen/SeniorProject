<div></div>
<p>On my project, I will attempt to use Codecademy as a tool for learning the beginning of web development. I will work through their course on webdev and apply those new skills to building my own website through PyCharm CE, an application used for web development.<p>
<p>I chose to learn web development for my senior project because I had always had that idea that I wanted to start coding and building websites. I always had that intuition that it would be beneficial for college and for my career, though I never had a strong initiative to embark on learning it. Granted, I had no prior experience, so taking an app development class this year helped ease into the process a little more and will make starting web development a bit easier. I want to be able to use these skills in college and take computer science classes or help my peers learn these skills or with budding business ideas.</p>
<p>I hope to gain skills that I can apply in my college courses, in helping other teens build websites/learn comp sci., and to be a more attractive employment option when the time comes. Besides for those reasons, I was always fascinated by people discussing computer science and programming and I was never able to partake in that convo. I want to be able to learn skills to educate myself so that I can have those types of conversations. Additionally, I want to build websites and combine my business and programming affinities into a viable career or find jobs where I can combine the two.</p>
<p>I felt that, in order to best explain my progression through these past four weeks, I would add my Daily Logs and Weekly Reflections onto my site. <div id="pleaselook"><strong>Please look below for my journey through Senior Project!</strong></div></p>

    <td>On my first day of project, I began my 14-class web development course. I finished 100% of HTML, which creates the bare bones of the website, and am about to begin CSS, which is the aesthetic of the website. Being that I have only done HTML, if I were to create a website, it would be unorganized, unattractive, and dull. HTML and CSS will work together to create the appearance of the website. However, I will have to continue to learn more languages in order to create the back-end activity of the website.</td>

    <td>4/23/19</td>
    <td>Today, I started the CSS class in Codecademy. In this lengthy class, I am learning about the aesthetic of the website and how to alert it. The various things we have control are the colors of both the text and background, their size, thickness, opacity, alignment, linking, location, and presentation. I am very interested in seeing how all of the pieces of the website creation are starting to be put together. Additionally, I had my first meeting with my sponsor, Ms. Simons. We checked in on my progress from yesterday and a bit of today and spoke briefly about my upcoming meeting with my out of school mentor, Mr. Chris Read, this Friday. We decided it’d be beneficial to create a list of a few questions so I can get to know him better.

    <td>I continued working on my CSS course on Codecademy. It has actually taken much longer than I had expected and contains much more content than I could imagine. Today, I worked on changing the colors of my web page, changing the text font and size, changing the arrangement, display, and position of objects, changing the borders, sizes, widths, and margins of objects, as well as the overall layout of the page. Tomorrow, I will pick up on the typography of CSS, though, as of now, I do not really know what that is.

    <td>4/25/19</td>
    <td>I learned what typography in regards to CSS is. Though it mainly refers to the font, it also contains the font style, family, weight (boldness), italics, color, word space, line height, and letter height. I was interested in working on the line height because I never gave much thought to it while viewing and reading off of websites in the past. After finishing up typography, we learned how to download third-party fonts off of Google and how to import them into the document. Another thing I did not know beforehand was that developers often place 1-2 backup fonts in case the original intended font is not possessed / cannot render on the user’s device. I am nearly down with the extensive class and plan to finish it up tomorrow, before my first meeting with my sponsor.</td>

    <td>Today, I met with my community sponsor at Starbucks in Winnetka. It was our first time meeting and we had not spoken too much beforehand. Going in, I was not incredibly sure of his expertise nor of who he is and where he works. Therefore, I decided to prepare these few questions: Background with comp sci/coding, Where/why did you learn?, Do you use it everyday for your job? What is your job?, Beneficial to learn?, Am I doing the right things to achieve my goals?, How do I host a website off of Brackets once I create it?, Will I only need to know HTML and CSS to build my website? If not, which other languages?, Do you know about the language, Ruby?, Any specific references you know of to check my code/use for help? We only got through a few of those question but they surely helped in allowing me to better curate my questions and discuss the important topics.

    <td>Weekly Reflection #1</td>
    <td>It was awesome to dive into coding and learning web development. Not only did I learn about web dev. And new computer skills, I learned a lot about my study habits. I focused best in between my periods 2 and 5 in which I had 2 straight hours to work. I found I was able to fill in my loose gaps with an additional hour after dinner, which often took me to 2.5-3 hrs / day. I really enjoyed my Codecademy course. I finished the HTML course in a day, but underestimated the intensity and length of the CSS course and it has taken me around 5 days to finish.
	In looking towards the next few weeks of project, I want to spend more time building my website, rather than learning the basics, though I understand I cannot do one without the other. Additionally, in meeting with my mentor, Chris Read, I was able to learn a ton about his role in computer science and he recommended me some next steps for my website creation. One of his suggestions was coupled with the online course; he said if I want to make a static website, which will align with what I want to accomplish as one of my outcomes for project, he said the majority of the classes in the Codecademy course will not yet be relevant. In all, I feel I was able to learn a lot both about my habits, goals, and coding this first week.

    <td>Today, I started working on my website in the app Brackets, though I did not get much code written, I attempted to acquaint myself with the platform and learn how to create and save new files. A few things I learned were that you need to specifically declare a code language in the file type and I realized the difficulty in changing the file names/locations. Moving forward, I need to learn more regarding how tio organize my files and form where, if at all, I can access them on my computer.

    <td>Today I continued working on my CSS course on Codecademy. I am, thankfully, almost done with it! However, despite being long, it has allowed me to really go in detail with CSS and learn the ins and outs of it. I hope, tomorrow, that I can begin to work on coding my website on Brackets. Additionally, I met with my mentor, Ms. Simons, today. We recapped last week’s meeting with my sponsor and I told her what I learned about his background and job. I forgot to mention this on last Friday’s log but he definitely undersold his history in comp. Sci, having founded multiple important businesses. Now, he works for a finance firm’s tech dept. in the city.

    <td>Today, I started to blueprint the structure of my website. I intend to create a site in which I will have a paragraph explaining my motivation for doing senior project and choosing web development. Under that, I will add a table which will have my daily logs copied and pasted from this document so people can see my progression during project. Tomorrow, I am meeting with my sponsor and I intend to start building my site tomorrow, too.

Though I have a background in HTML from my course, it was definitely helpful having his guidance in building the site. He helped me with the structure and organization of the code and I look forward to continuing to build my site. First, we will do HTML then shift to CSS.

    <td>Since yesterday, I have been able to reflect a bit on the meeting with my sponsor Chris Read. I originally walked in intending to learn a few more HTML tricks and the very basic ‘on the surface’ skills I would have asked for to create my website. Not only were we able to cover it, but Chris taught me a new form of code called Git. Git, which is commonly associated with the platform Github, is a method of connecting your code to an online database in which you can save versions of your code in repositories. Though I have not yet written much code, I will be able to monitor every change I make to my code throughout project! He taught me that this is especially helpful for those looking to experiment and deviate from their original project. Today, I researched more about it and started saving my code to my Github repository.

    <td>Weekly Reflection #2</td>
    <td>This past week was really beneficial in learning more about the variations of computer science and web development. I originally went in to project with an intention to learn the ‘on-the-surface’ skills in creating a website - solely the HTML and CSS components of how to build a site. As I want to create a static, informational website, I attempted to learn those basic skills through Codecademy and feel a level of proficiency in having completed those courses.
	However, though, I think my greatest growth thus far has come through working with my mentor, Chris Read. His background and knowledge has been quite eye-opening and he has exposed me to new programs, applications, and languages that I otherwise would not have encountered online. We spent our last meeting discovering new web development platforms like PyCharm CE, which serves the same function as Brackets, and got acquainted with platform Github which allows you to save versions and track changes in your code through the language Git.

That, coupled with studying for other classes’ AP exams, did not provide me with an adequate amount of time to continue coding my website. That being said, I plan to use tomorrow as a day to keep coding my website and experimenting with new HTML and CSS functions.

I came to the conclusion that I want to prioritize HTML and the structure of the website before I start to really focus on the aesthetic. As you can see above, the color scheme does is not very-well coordinated, so I will tackle that later. Maybe a light blue color scheme…?

Today, we tried to create a hyperlink, a link to press which will take you to a different page on the website. When we created the lnk, we realized it was not rendering exactly how we would have liked on the website. Therefore, we went to the open source code and viewed it through Google Chrome to see where our problem lie. We then went back to our code and continued to adjust our code to solve the problem.

    <td>Weekly Reflection #3</td>
    <td>This past week has been really interesting in the experimentation with web development. Being that I have gotten the bare bones down of HTML and most of CSS I have been able to start trying new things in the code.
        The first thing I tried was creating a table in my code in which I added all of my daily logs. That way, people who come to my board and view my website can sift through my progress on their own and see the authenticity of my project and its progression. Additionally, I experimented with creating multiple pages on my website. Based on my three outcomes, I want each page on the website to link to one of each of the outcomes. For example, my landing (main) page will be outcome two, the website and daily logs. Also, the other two pages will have my <a href="githubproof.html"><strong>proof</strong></a> of completing the two CSS and HTML classes and then my <a href="screencast.html"><strong>screencast</strong></a> of me explaining my code, respectively.

    <td>Today I continued to work on my website. I changed the color scheme to be a little more consistent and aesthetically pleasing. I also worked on adding in anchors, which are also known as hyperlinks. I used to different types of anchors in my site. The first one was href=“file.html”. This href was used to link pages to completely different pages. As you will see on my site, I used that href to connect to my other two pages on my website. The second href was href=#id. This can serve the same function as the first href, but is more commonly used to link to specific items, often times lower on the same page. I used this specific href for my “jump to” week x tabs, which will allow site viewers to jump to a specific week’s daily log.

Originally, it was to finish the CSS and HTML courses on Codecademy. However, after talking with my sponsor and experimenting with actually writing code, I realized that I was able to work in-depth on the website even without having finished the course based on how simple it is to find all the information online. That being said, I adjusted my outcome to be focused on my Github, a way in which I can upload new versions of my code to monitor and track changes. I will upload the screenshots of my repository to my website and explain the differences and reasons behind them.</td>
